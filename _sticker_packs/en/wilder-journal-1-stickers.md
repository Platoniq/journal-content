My name is Alba Feito and among other things I am an illustrator. I do it as a symbolic exercise in communication. To understand (myself).

I was born in Asturias and moved to Barcelona to study Fine Arts and later a master's degree in Philosophy. Besides my studies, my artistic practices have been shaped mostly by my collaborations in community projects (collective publications, organisation of festivals, a feminist performance group, fanzine publishing house, etc), and by the friends that life has given me, by travelling and dancing.

{% quote %}The ideas behind the drawings are always references to concepts that were put to me in the Platoniq commission. They have to do with community work, a space for joint debate. Some rather extravagant and peculiar characters. Concepts appeared to me in a sense of optimism, an activism based on understanding. Something that was creative and very direct. My drawing work is very symbolic and aims to express simple ideas. But I also like to leave a window open, to let the viewers make their own reading. It's a project that has been relatively easy for me to grasp, as they are concepts that I can feel represented by. When I draw I tend to understand with the body the concepts I'm working with, I know it wouldn't be the first thing we would think of when we draw but it's something I do with my practice. If what I'm working with doesn't make me feel comfortable, drawing becomes more difficult. In the project of representing Platoniq I could easily approach them.

My drawings have appeared in a lot of collective fanzines (some of my own), illustrated articles and book covers. They have been moved in several animation projects, hosted exhibitions and conducted workshops.Â 

My drawing practices also include my ceramic pieces, my paintings, or any of the possible approaches that may appear to me.

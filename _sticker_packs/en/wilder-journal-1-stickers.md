My name is Alba Feito and among other things I am an illustrator. I do it as a symbolic exercise in communication. To understand(me). I was born in Asturias and moved to Barcelona to study Fine Arts and later a master's degree in Philosophy. Besides my studies, my artistic practices have been shaped mostly by my collaborations in community projects (collective publications, organisation of festivals, a feminist performance group, fanzine publishing house, etc), and by the friends that life has given me, by travelling and dancing.

My drawings have appeared in a lot of collective fanzines (some of my own), illustrated articles and book covers. They have been moved in several animation projects, hosted exhibitions and conducted workshops.Â 

My drawing practices also include my ceramic pieces, my paintings, or any of the possible approaches that may appear to me.

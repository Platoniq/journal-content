* Deliberative assemblies in schools 
* Training of trainers and facilitators

* Research on democratic quality indicators

## **Consultancy and strategic accompaniment**

We accompany public and private entities in their processes of **development of participatory strategic plans**.

* Elaboration and facilitation of internal participation processes for the design of strategic plans.
* Participatory diagnosis + recommendations
* Theoretical framework and contextualisation with data
* Development of narratives to communicate the mission and vision 
* Evaluation of policies and strategic plans

## Democratic funding

[Goteo.org](https://www.goteo.org/) is our **civic crowdfunding platform**, through which we fund initiatives with social impact - at regional, national and international level, **encourage cooperativism** and strengthen **Social and Solidarity Economy**.

On the other hand, it is a pioneering and innovative platform regarding transparency **distribution of public resources**, with the creation of **[Matchfunding](https://www.goteo.org/matchfunding)**programmes**,** where the promoters of the campaigns receive other complementary funds from public entities depending on the success of the campaign and citizen validation.

* Matchfunding channels + crowdfunding consultancy
* Introduction to crowdfunding training
* Training in communication for crowdfunding campaigns
* Promotion of cooperativism: [Crowdcoop.org](http://matchfundin)

## Design of futures

We have extensive experience designing and developing visionary workshops that make us imagine and project a more ethical and desirable future.

* Training to empower young people in the fight against disinformation (for teachers and librarians)
* Co-creation workshops to generate ideas and tackle challenges collectively.
* Social Justice by Design Workshop: How to design inclusive, feminist and decolonial spaces 
* 'Imagining a More Ethical Future of Artificial Intelligence' Workshop 

## **Development of open source digital tools**

We have been defending and exercising the social use of technology for more than 20 years. That's why we develop open source tools to put them at the service of society and to impact on the democratic quality of public and private organisations.

* Goteo.org
* Decidim.org

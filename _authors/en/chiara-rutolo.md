In love with the Mediterranean and all its cultures and differences, Chiara studied International Relations on an Erasmus Mundus Master's degree that made her travel through France, Italy, Morocco and Spain. Since then she has been based in Barcelona, but continues to travel thanks to the European projects she writes for the Platoniq Foundation. Bringing her passion for intercultural communication, she is now specialising in facilitation and alternative finance, representing Goteo at international conferences.

## But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea

Of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, 


* The master-builder of human happiness. 

* No one rejects, dislikes,

* Or avoids pleasure itself


### Because it is pleasure


But because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure *rationally* encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 


Nor again is there anyone *who loves or pursues or desires* to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?

I am a researcher, driven by the values of social justice. I have conducted multiple projects to analyze public opinion and digital activism. My recent academic research is on social movements, gender and intersectionality. I am particularly interested in technopolitics, data justice, queer, latinx and black technocultures. I'm currently a PhD candidate at UOC and data manager at [Datos Contra el Ruido](https://datoscontraelruido.org/).

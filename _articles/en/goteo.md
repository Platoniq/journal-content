We are launching a crowdfunding campaign to redesign Goteo's code and continue transforming social needs into tangible solutions. Make your contribution and join us. Let the social and solidarity energy flow, because in a seemingly devastated world, we can still build change.

We live in an increasingly polarised reality: fake news, the rise of the far-right, climate denialism, conspiracy theories, all of these are challenges we cannot ignore. Against this backdrop, Goteo continues to be the community tool that builds the future together.

This is backed up by data. Since its birth, and thanks to its open technology, nearly 22 million euros have been redistributed among impact projects, 2,199 initiatives have been funded and more than 362,500 people and entities are part of the community that, united, have made it happen.

Goteo, but better: we are launching a campaign

We have set out to redesign and modernise Goteo, creating an architecture capable of integrating other platforms and applications in a simple and efficient way; optimising resources, reducing the number of services and servers, improving our efficiency, speed and response capacity; and creating more powerful tools, such as an administration panel, to facilitate campaign management and communication with users.

And for this we are going to redesign the code from scratch. A development that will lead us to improve the connectivity of the platform, allowing us to integrate Goteo with more tools and services, expanding its capacity for interaction with other technologies or the needs of the Social and Solidarity Economy ecosystem.

As well as a greater social and geographical impact that will allow us to reach more people, projects and territories, overcoming technical or geographical barriers, and enabling more users to benefit and participate.

We hope to be able to offer new functionalities that expand the platform's functions, adapting to the demands of users and the needs of the projects.

In short, we want to give greater visibility to the initiatives that are supported by Goteo in order to position them better and attract more support, increasing dissemination and possible collaborations.

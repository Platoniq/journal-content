Imagine a former industrial site now abandoned, that local residents want to convert into a community school!\
\
**Imagine a park that is used on a daily basis by local young people, local organic farmers and by a collective of elderly people.** Imagine that these residents could participate in taking decisions about the future of the area!\
\
Imagine a neighborhood once derelict and now upcoming, at risk of aggressive gentrification but with the presence of a strong grassroots community and local commerce interested in being involved in changing the future of their area for the best!\

Platoniq is proudly part of **OpenHeritage**, an EU project that wants to explore how such **participatory processes can be applied to heritage**. It identifies and tests the best practices of adaptive heritage re-use in Europe.

This model of governance is what we call collaborative governance. [Design Justice](https://designjustice.org/) gives collaborative governance a meaning and orientation that allows it to become a method and tool for diverse and inclusive participation that aims for greater social justice.

## Why do we think this question is relevant and related to our ethical compass (The story of me)

Platoniq's role within OpenHeritage (OH) largely revolves around the **collaborative governance of the online community and platform of the project that aims to develop and share best practices concerning adaptive heritage reuse**. Within the OH platform participants and administrators can co-create, exchange ideas, and collaborate to construct participatory spaces and projects within the larger OH initiative with 16 partners involved from Italy, Hungary, Poland, Belgium, U.K., Germany, Spain and Portugal as well as with the individual labs in Rome, Budapest, Sunderland, Prädikow, Praga, and Lisbon. The labs are heritage sites that use the platform as a tool and space to manage, and conduct their work with their communities and stakeholders.

However, a platform and its governance are not inherently oriented toward the desire for greater good without people and ideas to make it so. [Design Justice](https://designjustice.org/) within this context serves as a framework to build ideas and practices that give importance to vulnerable communities and individuals that might be involved and consciously pushing the needle of the project's ethical compass.

## State of the art

### What is Collaborative Governance?

Collaborative governance now for almost the last four decades has offered up the opportunity for new and refreshing ways to rethink how we make public spaces and services possible. Broadly described, **collaborative governance is a process in which 'state and non-state actors jointly \[address] an issue be they civil society, public, private organizations or individual citizens'**. However, this broad definition without an ethical moral compass does not inherently promise a means for a stronger democratic process or greater social transformation for a more egalitarian society. 

Currently within Platoniq's work at [Open Heritage](https://openheritage.eu/) we are collaborating with multiple organizations, communities, and public entities. We collaborate in different cities around Europe involved in adaptive reuse of heritage sites, working to support a more participatory process. For us, collaborative governance is not a hollow term meant to pay lip service to participatory processes. So we want to reclaim collaborative governance as a means not just for rethinking public services and goods, but also making them more transparent and fair.

## The Critique

The term collaborative governance is incredibly flexible, and it does not explicitly define who the non-state participants are or what should be the priorities within a collaboration. 

And one strong, academic critique has been that collaborative governance is actually 'post-political'. The term post-political came about a few decades ago where rather than see real change that incorporates disensus and different political opinions, public spaces and goods were managed through the 'expert social administration'. In regards to urban governance the post-political refers to a process of acting in the best interest of a city without further clarity as to who defines for whom and how we better the city and thus opens up the possibility of reinforcing pre-existing power dynamics and inequality. 

Incorporating post-political, we want to question the underlying ideas behind collaboration and consensus. **When implementing collaborative governance is there space for acknowledging disensus and power dynamics?** Within the lens of post-political it's important to acknowledge that we cannot assume that inclusion and diversity are a given in within consensus oriented governance. That being said this lens of post political helps us push towards our desire towards a collaborative governance that address power inequality and create processes to references for not just ourselves but those doing similar work as well.

### Incorporating Design Justice

To recover collaborative governance as an important pillar for building more socially just societies that designate greater decision making power to those traditionally marginalized, we can give it a backbone with the principles of Design Justice.

{% gallery { "simple": true, "images": [{"path":"/media/design-justice-1.jpg"}] } %}

[Design justice](https://designjusticenetwork.org/) came about during an Allied Media Conference in 2015. Since then as an organization Design Justice has come forth with an explicit political agenda for a practice that 'center\[s] those who stand to be most adversely impacted by...' a project or process. This idea goes against the traditional paradigm of design which generally looks like when an expert such as architect or urban designer create from their singular vantage point and with great decision making power, design the material spaces we live in. Consider the masters works of Oscar Niemeyer, a legendary architect whose designs heavily influenced the landscape of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil. From an aerial perspective his buildings and lines have a graceful or even [feminine](https://theculturetrip.com/south-america/brazil/articles/oscar-niemeyer-form-follows-feminine/) flow, but on the ground it's an un-walkable city where if you don't have a car you don't get far. However, **within the practice of design justice, designers facilitate the design process to be more oriented around impacted communities rather than be keepers of a singular solution for many**. At Platoniq we are often partners in facilitating participation and the management of public spaces and goods. So at no point in working with organizations and communities do we want to replicate this master plan complex in that alienates residents and communities from a place.

{% quote %}Infusing collaborative governance with Design Justice creates radical new possibilities for design and collaboration.{% endquote %}

For example let's take a look at Ansell and Gash's (2008) more nuanced six principles of collaborative governance (participedia):

* the process is initiated by a public agency or institution
* includes participation of non-state actors
* participants are not only to be consulted - they have decision making power
* the forum is a formal process and organised formally
* decision making is consensus-oriented
* the focus is related to public policy or public management

It looks like it could lend itself to better governance, but again who are these participants with decision making power? And how are they developing a consensus?

Now let's look at those principles through the lens of design justice:

* the process is initiated by a public agency or institution 
* includes participation of non-state actors centralizing people who are normally marginalized
* participants are not only to be consulted - they have decision making power to open up the design process to those who will be most impacted by its outcomes
* the forum is a formal process and organised formally and is transparent and accessible
* decision making is consensus oriented to dismantle structures that marginalize, dehumanize, subjugate, and oppress others while centralizing voices that are most marginalized by institutional racism, patriarchy, and colonization
* the focus is related to public policy or public management

What makes us excited about Design Justice is that it gives us an ethical compass for deciding who gets to sit at the table and how we should orient ourselves in creating new systems and infrastructure for communities. 

## Story of us (a series of objective data to back up the idea)

Much of how the Design Justice principles are interpreted in OH happen through developing new features and adapting the online platform of the project, Decidim. 

### Creating a Case with and for Sortition

Sortition very basically described is when participants in a project, community, or space are randomly selected into a working group. The idea is that through random selection the working group is not defined by politics or bias that might be held within the group. To create example of how this might work within OH, Platoniq initiated the creating of a collaborative, participatory text, 'OpenHeritage Manifesto'. The text draws from each word in the title of the project '**OpenHeritage: Organizing, Promoting and Enabling Heritage Reuse** through Inclusion, Technology, Access, Governance and Empowerment' and partners selected at random write an entry that connects their individual values to OH to create a whole text that reflects a unified vision from different heritage contexts. The text itself demonstrates how the practice of sortition has worked within the OH initiative and also serves a reference in terms of process for partners and those within the larger heritage community looking for practices that take an unbiased look at their own diversity to collaborate and co-create. 

### Developing a Feature to Measure Volunteer Hours

Working with the lab from Sunderland, **Platoniq is developing a feature to Decidim, that would allow volunteers to track their hours**. The effort is a means to demonstrate the manpower often precarious that goes into getting some heritage projects off the ground. Similarly, the lab in Prädikow has also become interested in getting involved, because they would like to demonstrate to public administrators the amount of unpaid labor that happens to push for more compensation for work at their heritage site. What was inevitable in both projects was the fact that volunteer labor would happen and was necessary. However, to create heritage practices that visibilise the work and even precarity might serve as a tool to create better working conditions or generate data to further build on the case for wider public support for what eventually become public goods i.e. sites of adaptive heritage reuse. 

### Working with Residents to Develop a Feature to Manage Collective resources

In the lab in Rome, residendents of Centocelle have formed a cooperative, CooperACTiva. The cooperative intends to give bike tours of the neighborhood, which was a former stronghold against fascism. Using the Decidim platform they intend to create a system for reservations and bike rentals. The initiative is completely resident led and working them allows for Platoniq to adapt the platform to their needs rather than having an imposed platform structure within their organising.

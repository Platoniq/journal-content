title: Strengthening the youth voice in mental health
description: The thinking revolution, also known as the Mindset Revolution, has
  emerged as an innovative movement to address the challenges faced by youth in
  relation to their mental health. In this article we will start from two poems
  written by Chimwemwe Chirwa, researcher at Mindset Revolution, to capture the
  essence of this initiative that seeks to give a voice to young women and allow
  them to share their experiences, thoughts and emotions in relation to mental
  health.

"Being well-adjusted to a profoundly sick society is not a good measure of health," said Jiddu Krishnamurti, according to writer Mark Vonnegut. Therefore, on this occasion we want to talk about the great importance of mental health in our current society, especially among the youngest.

The thinking revolution, also known as the Mindset Revolution, has emerged as an innovative movement to address the challenges faced by youth in relation to their mental health. In this article we will start from two poems written by Chimwemwe Chirwa, researcher at Mindset Revolution, to capture the essence of this initiative that seeks to give a voice to young women and allow them to share their experiences, thoughts and emotions in relation to mental health.

We want to talk about the reality of conventional systems and the need to transform them so that they are no longer cold and distant, creating a warm, welcoming and understanding space, through open and meaningful dialogue, innovation and collective healing as means to strengthen your well being.

Join us now on this journey through art as a tool of expression, to generate a positive and lasting change in the way this important issue is addressed in our society.

Chimwemwe Chirwa's second poem summarizes the work of the Legislative Theater group within Mindset Revolution. The poem describes an experience in which audience members, symbolized by an angel, can become legislative leaders and change the outcome of legislative plays related to mental health and the work environment.

The poem reflects on the struggles and challenges that workers face in a corporate environment, where individual power and voice seem to diminish. However, the angel, representing legislative action, arrives to provide hope and a path to liberation. This poem highlights Mindset Revolution's commitment to implementing real and legislative changes to improve people's lives, freeing them from oppressive structures and providing them with the restitution they deserve.

We are convinced that the thought revolution is a brave and transformative movement that seeks to strengthen the youth voice in mental health. Chimwemwe Chirwa's poems invite us to reflect on the importance of building platforms for dialogue and promoting legislative changes for the benefit of all.

The Platoniq Foundation, a key partner in this project, is providing its [Open Spaces](https://openspaces.platoniq.net/processes_groups/12) as a ‚Äúhaven‚Äù for independent community participatory processes. Its objective is to accompany strategic participation processes and offer design and facilitation services for hybrid participatory processes to communities that cannot afford these services. Additionally, documenting the process and working on a research article on how technology can give more visibility to these processes.

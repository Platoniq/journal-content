The mental health of young people is a pressing issue that demands immediate attention. It is a crisis that has escalated due to the pandemic and other socio-economic challenges. But what happens when young people take control and become the protagonists in the narrative of mental health? That's precisely what the Mindset Revolution project aims to achieve.

Mindset Revolution is an innovative project funded by UKRI/RSA and led by the University of Manchester, in collaboration with Katy Rubin, Youth Focus North West, Reform Radio, 42nd St, GM I-Thrive, and Platoniq. This initiative seeks to change the way young people's mental health is addressed by empowering them to design, implement, and lead their own participation.

The process is designed and facilitated by the young people themselves, who are provided with spaces and resources to invent their own participation platforms. They transition from being affected individuals to becoming full-fledged protagonists in their own journey, where their voices can be clearly heard and from where they can help shape youth mental health policies and transform service delivery.

Mindset Revolution employs an "assemblage" approach, combining digital and non-digital infrastructures, to facilitate participation. This approach is flexible and adaptable to the community's specific needs at any given time. Intersectionality is a fundamental component of this process, ensuring inclusive and diverse participation.

One of the key techniques utilized in this project is Legislative Theatre, which uses creativity and art as tools to drive policy change. Through this technique, young people create and perform a play that recounts their experiences with the mental health system. The audience, composed of professionals and policymakers, actively participates by providing solutions and committing to implementing changes.

Platoniq Foundation, a key partner in this project, offers its Open Spaces as a "haven" for participatory processes of independent communities. Their goal is to accompany strategic participation processes and provide design and facilitation services for hybrid participatory processes to communities that cannot afford such services. Furthermore, they are documenting the process and working on a research article exploring how technology can bring greater visibility to these processes.

The Mindset Revolution is beginning to demonstrate that change is possible, and there have already been commitments from mental health professionals and policymakers to take actions that can lead to significant change. This project represents a first step in a journey toward sustainable and youth-led participation.

Young people are undoubtedly the future. But they are also here, in the present, ready to be heard and make a difference. The Mindset Revolution is proving that by giving young people the platform and resources they need, they can become agents of change and help shape a brighter future for everyone. The revolution will not only be televised but also led by the youth.

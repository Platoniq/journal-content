Chimwemwe Chirwa wrote this short poem (originally published on [our Open Spaces](https://openspaces.platoniq.net/processes/mindset-revolution-resources/f/386/posts/82?locale=es)) to summarise what the Legislative Theatre group in [Mindset Revolution](https://next.journal.platoniq.net/en/wilder-journal-2/futures/revolutionmindset/) is doing. The first session we dropped in on as researchers they were doing a legislative theatre exercise that revolved around mental health and the workplace. The poem encompasses how the legislative theatre group uses audience members (in the poem's case the angel) to act as someone who can be a legislative leader and change the outcome of legislative plays.

*The liberating licks of tobacco can only linger for so long*

*There’s not enough people in today matey boy what’s going on*

*The corporate shadow laps up the sunshine that glisten in my eyes*

*They’re scrapping admin jobs to absolutely no surprise*

*You can threaten to leave but that won’t change a thing*

*Your capitalist bossman has already moved onto his next ting*

*The power you thought you had is dwindling at the picket line*

*You start to quite quit and tell all your other co-workers your fine*

*A stranger cladded in white between the exhausted crowds is waving at you*

*The individual calls out to you that the theatrics of your existence are about to be changed*

*You don’t have to live your life enraged* 

*For I am the angel for legislation*

*Here to build a better life for you a new foundation*

*Feel the sensation, vibration of your newly found spirit of affirmation*

*This toxicity doesn’t serve you anymore* 

*And I’m going to put plans in place so you shouldn’t have to suffer in this convenience store*

*The theatre of your life will come into law* 

*So you don’t have to fight constantly against the bourgeois* 

*Liberated from the shackles of institution* 

*Don’t you worry my dear you’ll get your restitution*

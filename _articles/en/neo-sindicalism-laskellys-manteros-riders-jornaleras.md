Not all citizens have the former right and now privilege of a permanent contract in a company that complies with labour rights and under the timely defence of a trade union, guild or association. In fact, the lives of many workers have worsened in Spain in just a few years with the liberalisation of dismissal, the decentralisation of collective bargaining and the erosion of the system of political representation during the economic recession.

In this article we look back to understand how the **traditional models of union organization are no longer effective due to high temporality, cultural differences and, above all, the fragmentation of the workforce**. We will be mainly accompanied by Las Kellys, who were born as a WhatsApp group in 2014, formed an association in 2016 and today form the Las Kellys Union. Along with them, many others are an example of neo-syndicalism that is here to stay.

## First of all, who are Las Kellys?

**The Kellys are the housekeepers affected by outsourcing processes who are on temporary contracts or whose working conditions have deteriorated** or have never been in accordance with the conditions set out in the collective agreement. Most of them do not belong to the central staff of the hotels, and in any case they are most commonly employed on temporary contracts of 3 or 6 months, which are hardly ever renewed.

Working side by side with them are the waitresses who have not suffered this deterioration in their working conditions, **they belong to mainstream unions and have not felt so directly the need to demand these corporate improvements related to outsourcing**. This first difference is key to establishing the demands and understanding the conflict around their working conditions. For the latter, the hotel and catering collective bargaining agreement is still the benchmark for establishing their labour rights, so their struggle is focused on the hotel and catering sector and not on corporate improvements for the housekeepers as the Kellys do.

## Okay, remind me what a union is for

Trade unions are associations made up of workers who defend and promote their interests at work, vis-à-vis the employer and with whom they have a contract. In Spain, CCOO is the leading union and UGT the second, with the two unions holding the hegemony of representation with 75% of the total number of delegates. The labour reforms of 1994, 1997, 2010 and 2012 have led to a process of decentralisation of collective bargaining, which has considerably reduced its bargaining power, facilitating the reduction of wage costs with greater flexibility in hiring and firing.

**With fragmentation, the profile of non-standard workers proliferates, those who do not meet the parameters of a continuous, stable and full-time** working life, i.e. workers in a temporary or part-time relationship, working at a location other than the organisation's headquarters, or subcontracted or self-employed workers who provide services to other companies.

In the case of **room maids, the majority belong to this profile**, with a **temporariness of 80%** and only 13% of contracts are permanent (Servicio Público de empleo Estatal 2019).

This temporary nature is a source of insecurity, both personal, social and monetary, and is associated with exclusion from the collective bargaining process, with a weakening or elimination of their demands and loss of protection under the agreement in some cases.

With outsourcing, the company subcontracts central positions of its activity to various companies, reducing costs and controlling the labour conflict that tends to differentiate jobs. With these reforms, each worker can have different conditions and unitary collective bargaining is made more difficult by limiting the effectiveness of sectoral agreements. By breaking with the scenario where people live in relatively similar conditions and have common collective experiences through their jobs, labour identity is fragmented, as we have already seen in the case of housekeepers.

## The Phantom Union Delegation

{% gallery { "simple": true, "images": [{"path":"/media/neosindicalism_3.png","credits":"Dante de La Vega","caption":"The ghosts of the union organization"}] } %}

Do you have someone in the union who won't even listen to you? Unfortunately this is very common. The law requires there to be at least one trade union delegate in companies with more than 6 workers, but in most cases this figure is diluted for two main reasons: lack of commitment from the people who make up the delegation, which leads to inactivity from the trade union side; or the presence of "yellow" delegations, i.e. those formed by candidates presented by the company itself. This fact directly affects the perception that workers have of trade union action and of their effective capacity to improve their daily reality with regard to their jobs.

This is how **the company often limits the capacity for union organisation among the chambermaids**, **limiting communication between workers** from different companies and creating greater defencelessness and isolation among those who are already outsourced. The Kellys experience on a daily basis the absence in their work environment of a person who supports them and defends their interests, together with the fear of losing their jobs. These factors increase the gap between this feeling of lack of representation and their own capacity to denounce and participate in trade unions. Their perception is that trade unions make little effort to inform and inform them of the tools available, in many cases being immigrants and unfamiliar with the legal system and even the language.

## Las Kellys breaking schemes: association, union and much more

{% gallery { "simple": false, "images": [{"path":"/media/neosindicalism_4.png","caption":"'Popular union of street vendors'","credits":"Anonymous"}] } %}

Faced with this situation, **The Kellys decided to form their own union because of the need to create a tool with greater legal guarantees than the one they had as an association**. After winning a lawsuit in which they managed to reverse an outsourcing at a hotel, they decided that forming a union would allow them to achieve a degree of protection that they had not been able to find with the association. As a union, they will be able to confront the processes that had been deteriorating their working conditions, assuming that it is up to them to change things.

The existence of a Kellys Union sends a very clear message: The majority unions (CCOO-UGT) did not offer solutions to the problem when they went to talk to them, to effectively defend their rights, so they cannot be considered actors that can represent their interests and it is necessary to take the initiative to take control over their conflict.

This decision is a constructive criticism, the Kellys value and understand that the trade unions are the basic channel of negotiation with the employers for the signing of the agreement and confirm the instrumental vision that the workers have of the majority trade union organisations, only that they ask to be recognised as interlocutors, relieving the trade unions as the channel through which their demands have to be interposed and that these have to represent their interests as workers. Faced with the limitations of the law on freedom of association in terms of representativeness and through their other role as an association, they exert pressure - not only on the trade unions - but also on the other political and economic organisations responsible for the situation.

The strategy they will carry out is subtle and effective: because of the workers' fear of losing their jobs, they move their activism outside their usual workplace. Understanding the trade union struggle as a struggle for general improvements, through support for other female colleagues, and not as a concrete struggle to change specific conditions within their workplace, they organise themselves to act in other companies. The Kellys thus break with the atomisation of the mainstream unions, establishing networks and strategies for action outside the workplace. **The union is no longer a "tool" but a "sisterhood" where active participation, networks of affection and trust are promoted**. As Kelly, you can develop your activity within the union without your company being challenged by you, but by your "sisters" working in other hotels.

Only in hotels where several committed colleagues organise themselves, solve the conflict together, protect themselves and at the same time give visibility to the problem, will you be able to make demands from within the company. In this way, they avoid the lack of protection of individual complaints and make visible the general situation of precariousness that they face in the profession.

**The fact that the Kellys are both an association and a trade union allows them to be more flexible than a mainstream trade union.** The association is the entry and attention channel for workers who need help, being more welcoming for non-unionised people, and at the same time it allows them to attend to the demands of those who are not covered by their workplace. In this way, through the association, they provide advice and support to housekeepers without necessarily having to be members. In this way, they help to establish networks beyond affiliation, leaving the acquisition of trade union delegations at a secondary level in their model of action.

## Are there more like them?

Of course, this new typology of unions that make visible the oldschool vs. newschool conflict is very present in migrant collectives and new jobs linked to platform capitalism, where international companies employ fake freelancers for their core business. **Capital has used new technologies to reorganise the production process and often labour relations as well.** Both industry and services are going through a process of profound transformations and even technological ruptures.  As a result, both traditional and innovative companies such as digital platforms are promoting new ultra-flexible and precarious models of work organisation, which for the moment are being combated either by work cooperatives, such as the riders, or trade unions such as the Mantero or Las Kellys.

In the case of the gig economy, a form of work in which the provider and the applicant contact each other online through digital platforms to contract sporadic jobs, digital trade unionism has reacted by confronting some of these collaborative platforms in the courts. **RidersxDerechos succeeded in getting the 24th Social Court of Barcelona to rule that 748 Deliveroo delivery drivers were employees**, establishing in the ruling the existing employment relationship.

In this sense, new non-conventional forms of organisation have been emerging, among which the following should be highlighted:

* Petitioning platforms, such as Coworker.org, which allow individuals and groups to launch and join campaigns aimed at improving their working conditions. 
* Social networks, where powerful digital trade unionism can be built, given their capacity for dissemination and convening, and the reputational damage that a viral campaign can inflict on a company. 
* Meeting forums, where new technologies not only allow gig economy workers to denounce and complain, but also to share their experiences, such as the Turkopticon search engine, through which Amazon's Mechanical Turk workers, originally independent and disorganised, can discuss their work and evaluate their customers, so that other workers know which ones to avoid. 
* Digital cooperativism, which we are already familiar with, where, in the face of the prevailing precariousness in certain labour sectors, digital cooperatives are emerging with their own platforms that put workers and clients in direct contact with each other, thus avoiding the costs of intermediation.

It is clear that the emergence of **these new structures stems from a lack of confidence in trade union institutions and the need for direct tools to lobby for the improvement of their working conditions**. They are not going in blindly and they know that in order to influence collective bargaining, the majority unions are the channel for their demands to be structured and defended. Their aim is to condition their representativeness through lobbying strategies.

In short, **the Kellys' movement, together with others, manages to involve workers who had never before participated in political-union activities by being the seed of an increase in their self-confidence and self-esteem**, as well as in a greater knowledge of their rights and how to claim them. They experience personal empowerment as a result of collective participation, highlighting the positive impacts this participation has on their family life, as this empowerment allows them to experience growth in all areas of their lives. Thus, trade union participation can function as an element of empowerment not only in terms of work, but also in personal and, in the case of women, gender terms. The response to labour flexibilisation is participatory flexibility that is not anchored to the workplace, involving many more women colleagues in a broader group that is not only linked to the feminist movement by putting life at the centre, but defines itself as such.

This article ends here, so if you are interested in knowing more, we invite you to continue learning about and reading "[Letter: Towards a feminist inter-union](https://www.pikaramagazine.com/2022/05/carta-hacia-una-intersindical-feminista/)" where it is expressed: We are convinced that feminism is an indisputable engine of change when it breaks down the boxes and puts at the center the concrete life of women, trans people, dissidents, communities in rebellion. That's why we want to be more. We want to multiply the plots of cooperation, mutual support, shared struggle between us.

Are you passionate about preserving community heritage and looking for ways to get involved? You just found The Restoration Toolbox! This new project aims to empower citizens to take collaborative measures to preserve their own community heritage through open-source methodologies.

[The Restoration Toolbox](https://therestorationtoolbox.com/) aims to create an easy-to-use digital platform that connects various stakeholders, including property owners, communities, artisans, space managers, professionals, and civic authorities, to collaborate on community heritage safeguarding projects. Lack of awareness or access to correct technical information or trained professionals has led to the demolition of many historic buildings, resulting in a loss of identity and narrative for the city and community. Restoration and renovation of old buildings contribute to the circular economy and are key strategies to achieving sustainability and climate resilience.

The project is being co-created by [Jugaadopolis](https://jugaadopolis.com/), a social innovation initiative based in New Delhi, and the Platoniq Foundation, a social innovation driving force based in Barcelona with extensive experience in digital and participatory citizen participation. The project has already received initial funding from the Goethe Institute/Max Muller Bhawan as part of the C3: Codes, Community Creativity program.

Key values of the project include empowering and enabling young people, accessibility for all through digital technologies, involving all beneficiaries and stakeholders in the co-creation process, implementing the project in a hybrid manner to be more cost-effective, and openly sharing learnings to enable replicability of the project.

The Restoration Toolbox has an impressive list of project partners, including members of EUNIC, Alliance Fran√ßaise de Delhi, Institut Francaise en Inde / The French Institute in India, Dutch Culture, Jugaadopolis (Aishwarya Tipnis Architects), Toxic Links, O.P. Jindal University, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA), Platoniq, Eutropian, and the EU Delegation in India.

The project will involve the development of the platform, co-creation workshops, training and seminars, and a digital fellowship. The project timeline will be announced soon.

The Restoration Toolbox is an opportunity for anyone passionate about community heritage preservation to participate in a collaborative project that will have a real impact on their community. Join us and help make a positive impact on the future of our cities and communities.

The event will take place on April 19, 2023, at 5 pm in the ML Bhartia Auditorium, located at the Alliance Fran√ßaise de Delhi. The aim of the platform is to empower citizens to restore their buildings, democratize the heritage conservation process, improve access to experts, and create a space for collaboration between citizens and policymakers to enhance our lives and neighborhoods.

During the event, there will be a roundtable discussion on the "reduce, reuse, and recycle" concept as a design strategy, and the platform will be presented as a tool to achieve this objective.

Don't miss this unique opportunity to learn about heritage conservation and the circular economy. We look forward to seeing you there!

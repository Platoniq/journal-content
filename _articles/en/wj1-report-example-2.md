There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. No, I did not kill Kitty. However, I am going to oblige and answer the nice officer's questions because I am an honest man with no secrets to hide.

There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. Oh, you're gonna be in a coma, all right. __Steve Holt!__ *We just call it a sausage.* Across from where?

## It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you.

I hear the jury's still out on science. Guy's a pro. It's a hug, Michael. I'm hugging you. I'm a monster. I hear the jury's still out on science.

2. No… but I'd like to be asked!
3. Guy's a pro.

### I'm half machine. I'm a monster.

Well, what do you expect, mother? No! I was ashamed to be SEEN with you. I like being with you. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Across from where?

What's Spanish for "I know you speak English?" Steve Holt! I care deeply for nature. Michael! I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.

But I bought a yearbook ad from you, doesn't that mean anything anymore? Army had half a day. Steve Holt! Across from where?

Steve Holt! Say goodbye to these, because it's the last time! I'm a monster. Now, when you do this without getting punched in the chest, you'll have more fun. Whoa, this guy's straight?

Michael! That's why you always leave a note! We just call it a sausage. I'm half machine. I'm a monster.

There's only one man I've ever called a coward, and that's Brian Doyle Murray. No, what I'm calling you is a television actor. I don't criticize you! And if you're worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense.

Marry me. That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' That's what it said on 'Ask Jeeves.' First place chick is hot, but has an attitude, doesn't date magicians. It's called 'taking advantage.' It's what gets you ahead in life.

I care deeply for nature. I'm afraid I just blue myself. There's so many poorly chosen words in that sentence. I hear the jury's still out on science. Army had half a day. No, I did not kill Kitty.
